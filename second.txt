@cnnbrk Too little, too late, too insincere. Your real feelings were on display when you said it.
@cnnbrk what the hell is wrong with some of you? "Ew, wtf", "but why use that picture".. MAYBE that's all the pictures they have access to?
@CNN @CarolCNN other options exist for TV viewing that will be equally as awesome
@CNN @CBS @MSNBC @ABC @NBCPolitics if the emails were hacked by #Putin via #wikileaks why are they even discussed, playing into their hands
@CNN CNN is working to advance Hillary! They are biased!
@CNN @CNNOriginals Unless they decide to up kids in same profession in my view it is horrible choice of profession legalizing it is wrong
@CNN Destroy another white guy #christinebrennan is an ugly woman. Inside and out. #feministsareugly
@CNN @donlemon please stop these people when they quote @HillaryClinton! Its a lie that Hillary talked about @realDonaldTrump HAIR.
@CNN don't let the dour hit them in the ass good riddance
@CNN For those of you who believe the polls have been honest...
@CNN @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC @MSNBC How about it's not that trump wants @HillaryClinton hurt just wants her & Washington 2 live like us??
@CNN Get used to those stripes, cuz you'll be wearing them soon
@CNN Go tell these kids that have a life now that their seizures are gone that the thing that helps them isnt medicine
@CNN Hold up they don't love you like I love you slow down they don't you like I love you.
@CNN Hopefully they can determine what exactly happened that led to his shooting. I'm sorry for his family's loss. :'(
@CNN. How many people of color are there? I only see one race of people. Remember, optic are everything right?
@CNN how's third place treating you imbeciles? You are hacks and no one cares what you think or report. You are liars and irrelevant.
@CNN id bet alot of clinton voters want to change their vote, idk why youre pushing this wont help HER
@CNN I do not understand how we the American people do not see the monster he truly is. It's like looking at Adolf Hitler reincarnated.
@CNN if someone offered anyone that works there millions of dollars to speak are they going to turn it down
@CNN if you believe in Americas laws and values than you know Donald is right. If there is no penalty, there is no crime
@CNN I guess they've become accustomed to being lied to! Change is difficult for many, even change for the better!
@CNN I know a lot of people find this funny when it really is not funny. Hormonal changes are bad for both men and women.
@CNN I'm a lesbian and I don't give a damn. Why must everyone make a big fucking deal about who they love? What difference does it make?
@CNN I'm glad these guys make a good wage. But it baffles the mind as to why they make so much and teachers make 1/2 or less than them.
@CNN I'm tired of this! maybe we (as humans ) don't have the maturity, responsibility, respect, and love of life to be TRUSTED with fire arms
@CNN @IngrahamAngle Ask the white working class guy We R honor driven We R not like U Don't want to B U = Hillary
@CNN is notorious for staging bullshit! Y'all have been caught lying probably more then all the other media companies out here put together.
@CNN is that why she is repeatedly lying to the American people. What a hypocrite. She would not know the truth if it slapped her face
@cnni the movement that helped destroy the black family from within
@CNN it's very sad that this country is becoming as equal of a country as a third world. Because of idiots that have no respect for life
@CNN i watch everyday, and so far i hear minimal positives about @realDonaldTrump! Come on stop being unfair about your coverage!
@CNN I will never understand why we can't grasp the concept that we are all one race (human). We are ALL THE SAME! Race isn't a choice.
@cnn @jaketapper talking about pay to play and you change the subject to trump?really?Lets stick to the subject not divert from the subject
@CNN @JohnBerman am I the only one that thinks Obama is smug and don't believe a word that he says he could sit there and bold face lie
@CNN like he's going to say yeah we did it! Lol
@CNN @lisaling YES & mentally ill should b separated from rest of society -we r 2 politically correct 2 do it and 2 short on prison space
@CNN @MSNBC @Morning_Joe having illegals afraid of just trying to have a decent life that even their status against the law or not.
@CNN @MSNBC we need to keep asking him for his taxes instead of the birther issue in which we already know he lied. We want to see the taxes
@CNN @NAACP but there was no problem when the same election system that voted in our first blk President twice
@CNN Of course they do! Do your job and become a real news company!
@CNN ok you cant trust what middle schoolers do. Freakin guys in my middle school snorted pixie sticks.
@CNNPolitics America not worried. Before November Hillary will be in Bellevue barking over & over
@CNNPolitics and it's Hillary who wants to take away your guns right?
@CNNPolitics @Arianedevogue This is the back door battle the republican machine is spending powerful amounts of money to win the office!!
@CNNPolitics @cnnbrk Guess she's planning World War III because WWII WAS the Biggest Jobs Program of that time period.
@CNNPolitics @cnn Has Trump found a way to blame Hillary yet? He seems to know all about it, kinda suspicious if you ask me.
@CNNPolitics @CNN @JDiamond1 America doesn't need a person who is acting like a child, trump is not the solution for this job folks!
@CNNPolitics CNN loves this posting! Seems they can't come up with anything better. Time Warner having bad publicity & disgruntled viewers
@CNNPolitics CNN promting lies and hate - no wonder the country is in ruins - the media is running it.
@CNNPolitics Damn right. Why do we have to take the trouble makers too? We have our own problems here. We don't need others.
@CNNPolitics He should - this is very much an issue in the American black community! I take NO OFFENSE so stop characterizing it as such!
@CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton Marco Rubio is a two face after all the crap he talks about trump now they are buddies
@CNNPolitics Instead of deleting gov emails or pleading the 5th? Cnn knows she is corrupt yet u push this BS!
@CNNPolitics I owe u $400 M. I say F U. You say, " I'll cut their heads off if you don't pay up! " I pay up. Is that a ransom payment? You bet
@CNNPolitics I think no, for what! he is not fixing any thing in there! JA.
@CNNPolitics just what come one want to have the codes
@CNNPolitics #LOL nobody kept a copy of those #emails 4 her? #CrookedHillary 4get what w/ in the emails she destroyed? Should of kept the HD
@CNNPolitics @LoriSums So @HillaryClinton wants the input from a bunch of morons? Shut up @timkaine until the election is over!
@CNNPolitics @MSNBC needs to find more info on @realDonaldTrump taxes. He hasn't paid any taxes since 2000. He's hiding a lot. Why audit?
@CNNPolitics @POTUS Too bad he did not give a better example. He has been delusional about his accomplishments, manipulative and misleading
@CNNPolitics Question should be raised is 'what took so long for this email to be disclosed?' Judicial Watch had to go to court for it. WTF!
@CNNPolitics Sage advice from the Tell it like it is guy Those of us that Love and Trust Hillary knows her Heart and wants America to see it
@CNNPolitics shame shame shame; In God we trust. Worship the Lord your God and only Him; love your neighbour as yourself. Stop war..
@CNNPolitics Still nothing in NYC, NJ and MN terror attacks... cnn staying in the bottom for good reason. CNN working overtime to bury story
@CNNPolitics stop white knighting.. no one cares about your opinion
@CNNPolitics the only way Obama would have a legacy is if he did not support a crook like Hillary
@CNNPolitics The problem is their schools are sub par run by people that chase after their own betterment not those of the schools
@CNNPolitics This idiot flip flops on all his so called issues. WISHY WASHY. And he makes no sense at all. HE IS A LOSER.
@CNNPolitics Whenever I read the other comments, I need to punch my bag out
@CNNPolitics Why follow his every move?? Where is the news in that? So his plane landed, big deal! Will you follow the motorcade too?
@CNNPolitics yeah we get it, bought and payed 4. Who doesn't own her? Oh yeah American people
@CNNPolitics yes cause its all smoke and mirrors to make sure trump answers correctly and does not sound like an idiot
@CNNPolitics You don't need a header to know it's S or TS info. Any person can make that determination based on the content itself.
@CNNPolitics You would think he might want to know what his new CEO thinks & who he associates with before he hires him, wouldn't you?
@CNN POTUS didn't go to Louisiana. What not criticizing him like you did for Bush during Katrina bias reporting again.
CNN reporter apologizes for something she didn't need to apologize for.
@CNN Report on Trump owing 3 billion $ in loans 2Russia 4 buildings on USA soil shows in his tax as reported this summer in newspapers
@CNN Says the guy who tells Women they should have their body banned in ads. Lmao this hypocrite @SadiqKhan Also says free speech is bad.
@CNN she said she'd do it as senator... and didn't. She full of more lies.
@CNN so I'm confused @DonaldJTrumpJr if the hot mic talk was reality then why would ur pig dad call it just locker rm talk? Which is it?
@CNN: stop ur damn lies, if the 2000 election wasn't rigged for Bush then no elections have been rigged. Ur gonna loose dude so man up.
@CNN Straight to the point. its only in my country putting criminals in jail is so difficult. Not in the west. I trust justice will be done
@CNN tell Mr Sorkin to look at the Trump children and hope that his parenting skills yield those type results!
@CNN TEN YEARS???? I wanna escape Trump sooner than that
@CNN that beta male needs to shut the fuck up
@CNN The Clinton news network is emotionally upset HC health issues " BrainDamage " are being discussed but had no problem when JMcCains was!
@CNN the example tgey are setting for their kida if they have them is well u dont get your way throw a tantrum  burn things yell  scream duh
@CNN The hypocrisy from the Clintons and CNN is so thick that you can hear the backfires already coming next Wednesday morning...Trump wins.
@CNN Then tell my dog that because she loves paper and shredding it. I show her paper and tell her NO NO. Does she listen? NO NO.
@CNN The only faith she knows is lie lie lie and lie some more.
@CNN These are the people that chant LOCK HER UP over and over again and they are offended when she calls it like everyone sees it. Ha Ha Ha
@cnn these people have a valid point. This is about water Politicians who don't live here aren't concerned. We all,should be.
@CNN The thing is, people are aware that this is the way you work. They think : CNN is fucking us.
@CNN this along with the utter lack of originality is why I never cared for country music - redneck - time to replace him on the voice
@CNN This is no game, Trump is a very dangerous demagogue and your ratings should not be an excuse to allow him a platform.
@CNN Trump will never get the african american vote ever mostly because of some of his supporters
@CNN we got to stand strong together because it makes the world a better place to live.. Love our world and the people on it
@CNN WEST DR CARSON R EVEN HERMAN CAIN & SURE NO BLACK GOP PERSON WE WOULDA HAD 2 YELL @ THEM 2 SHOW SAME AS WHITE WOMAN & DIDNT WANT U 2
@CNN what nerve Donald Trump has calling Pennsylvania cheaters! I wouldn't vote for him once never mind five times! Is he paying for votes?
@CNN Why does what this one man have to say matter everyday?
@CNN why do you feel the need to exploit these children. Their lives aren't something trivial to be used as media
@cnn why would you have that fraud who for yrs. tried to pass herself off as black as a panelist? She has no credibility!
@CNN You are just trying too hard and still don't get it. #WeAreNotStupid @realDonaldTrump is going to win in a landslide.
@CNN You make me laugh at this explanation. With the GPS accuracy available to US FORCES. This is unacceptable
@CNN You still don't get it. We are looking for someone who can't fake it.

Not having to set your alarm #bestfeelingever
no, the grass isn't greener on the other side, the grass is only green where you water it
Nothin better than FGL on these long bus rides
nothing beats laying in bed on a shitty day with lattes while watching pll ?? ?? ??
Nothing beats the smell of a freshly cut Christmas tree ??
nothing beats the smell of freshly brewed coffee ??
Nothing better than being curled up on the couch watching Christmas movies because it's the most wonderful time of the year.
Nothing better than the smell of freshly dyed hair ??????
Nothing brings a family together like a good ol ' roast.
Nothing brings a family together like a random text from Gramma to her entire contact list that makes no sense to anyone.
Nothing brings our family together quicker than home cooked food. My Seattle family arrives tomorrow and lasagna
Nothing brings you and ya girl together like a pregnancy scare
Nothing compares to a beautiful conversation with a beautiful mind. ??
NOTHING COULD RUIN MY MOOD AT THIS POINT IM SO HAPPY IM SO GLAD I BOUGHT ALL OF THOSE COPIES AND STREAMED IT NON STOP I REGRET NOTHING
Nothing for me to do -_-
Nothing for me to do but have one last cry ??
Nothing I hate more than a pub full of children. I don't want. To sit. With your children.
Nothing in your social life in high school will ever matter in college so take lots of naps & don't care if you look cool
nothing is more beautiful than when the whole stadium is singing cielito lindo
Nothing is worse than negative people... So ugly.
Nothing is wrong or right in this world.. Everything is relative
Nothing is wrong with you, he is just a cheater. And he will never stop being a cheater
Nothing left to do but put it in a sweet
Nothing like a little Biochem in the morning

nothing more frustrating than when the aux stops working for no good reason
Nothing pisses me off more then fake people. If you don't like someone, don't act like you do #AreYouSerious #LikeReally
Nothing pisses me off more then when people have nothing better to do then criticize people's choices
nothing to do ??
Nothing to do and I'm not sleepy
Nothing to do a Saturday night what's new?
Nothing worse than a negative nancy trying to ruin other people's happiness
Nothing worse than negative energyy
Nothing worse than negative ppl ?? - That's right
Nothing worse than surrounding yourself with someone who is negative all the time.
Not in a very happy mood anymore.
not just a coincidence #confirmed
Not knowing how to fight don't make a nigga scary
Not knowing is the worst feeling ever
-- not knowing what vibe we wanted to give off and scrapping entire songs after days of work because they didn't feel right. We are both ---

Not sure what's worse - this third quarter or our whiny ass negative fans on Twitter.
Not sure why I get so stressed signing up for classes, worst case is I'll take/ pay for a class I don't need.. no that's still pretty bad ??

@Nyanderpful Birds can't hug, but here is one that wishes he could.
@NYDailyNews He doesn't deserve 1 penny of that amount. He DESERVES a trial and jail time. But we don't have trials for bank execs, do we?
@nytimes and it's your business because?in the US there are no princes but they don't pay taxes and take their money to the Cayman Islands.
@nytimes Any self respecting American would not ride in a cab with that foreign filth committed to overthrowing USA. Animals.
@nytimes Ask Kelly about her heated moment with Brit Hume to get a hot spot on Fox which resulted a divorce from 1st husband...
@nytimes Because there isn't going to be one world government most people don't want that we want borders! Hey liberals kiss my ass!
@nytimes Better watch for cartels who can launch mortar attack. These guys are well armed these days & they hate him.
@nytimes come on really? That's fucked up, I swear people these days are just plain just doing whatever to get on the news it's sad
@nytimes destroyed the country and pretends to be victim! Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
@nytimes In itself this is a bigly signal of defeat. He's never even taken a dump that didn't have the name TRUMP on it.
@nytimes in ny they through me out of a cafe just i ate my own bread too
@nytimes It's going to be really funny when the rest of the vote comes in and shows Trump in the lead.
@nytimes it's not about the country it's about tearing down Obama legacy because he's black.
@nytimes I would tell Brazil to go get bent
@nytimes, l all they're trying to do is take the heat off them
@nytimes @nytopinion black on white crime is covered up it is the biggest lie in America
@nytimes @nytopinion free speech has gone beyond respect. Show a little class people! Can't you find a way to offend without sounding vulgar
@nytimes @nytopinion It's not about Hillary pleasing everyone it is about her staying on the path that she has been on since college, caring
@nytimes people acting like everyone in prisons are rapists and murderers when 80 % are non violent drug offenders
@nytimes Power is all that matters. He will sandbag this. It's kind of an all or nothing moment tho ain't it? Choose wisely bureaucrat.
@nytimes RIP NYT. If nothing else comes out of this election, at least we all know where NOT to find facts.
@nytimes " She hit her head so hard in the fall that she sometimes forgets to rinse the soap from her butthole " - Bill Clinton
@nytimes So are you allowed to speak up if people say stupid things? Not to embarrass them of course, but just to say, disagree? Or nah?
@nytimes telecommuting saves lives people injured need to work veterans the disabled and work comp injured deserve to work.
@nytimes That is low debt for a company worth billions
@nytimes The Brazilian people demand and deserve more than that, above all, sincerity and the whole truth.
@nytimes. The face u make when everyone knows your guilty but you don't give a shit.
@nytimes @UpshotNYT you would forecast a win for @HillaryClinton if every other poll showed her losing can't bite the hand that feeds you
@nytimes Waleed's story doesnt mention the petition in parliament to fix the problem
@nytimes was a message show in music in light of the current protest going on into cities. Need Freedom song rings true

@nytimes your fact checker has proven to be broken! Or wrong. We've done neutral checks and it seems to not providing info on Clinton's lies
@nytpolitics @nytimes that's what happens when you try to create the news instead of reporting it#justsayin

@realDonaldTrump No you can't make America great again. Only the people can with tolerance, respect, pulling together, helping each other.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes If u don't like what NYT writes then - Buy it. Put up or shut up.
@realDonaldTrump OK you want records released. How about those tax returns. I think you owe the American people some answers.
@realDonaldTrump omg everyone talks shit behind closed doors. We love you Donald. MAKE AMERICA GREAT!!'
@realDonaldTrump only wants to cancel the election so he won't be exposed as a #loser #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor @FoxNews Yes. People enjoy watching you put your big fat foot in your mouth every time you speak!
@realDonaldTrump Out of your own mouth you said some foul sh*t about women, and now there are accusers? How stupid are you?!?!
@realDonaldTrump @pacsgirl36 let it go! You have all the support that's as good as it gets. Not even negative ads could make him feel worse.
@realDonaldTrump pence doesn't seem to anyways agree with your so called plans. Has his own... maybe he wants to be President.
@realDonaldTrump @piersmorgan Sir, don't forget Tomey has to cover his own ass in case you are elected.

@realDonaldTrump Really? Because all we hear from you is empty rhetoric with no real solutions or proposals. Need to hear a plan, man!
@realDonaldTrump really tells the dishonest Bribery story and what they don't want us the people to know
@realDonaldTrump refuses to release tax returns because his net worth has fallen 60 %. That's what all the best sources are saying.
@realDonaldTrump release your tax returns so we know who your bosses are.
@realDonaldTrump Remember Mitt was up 5% and still lost from no late advertising in last two weeks. Make a infomercial for that time. MAGA!
@realDonaldTrump replace with what? will it cover my pre-existing conditions? Leave it the fuck alone.
@realDonaldTrump @rhondar @CNN @BreitbartNews Do you really want someone that's gone backrupt so many times run your " Business ", or ruin it.
@realDonaldTrump @RobKovacev @CNN the Media is trying really hard to push the tax story during the Clinton foundation FBI investigation
@realDonaldTrump Running the country is not like running a business. You cannot fire Americans for disagreeing with you without becoming a &gt ;
@realDonaldTrump sad is that they allowed a scam artist and a fake to destroy them. Unworthy Trump
@realDonaldTrump Sad news for you :America is great! We do it every day and we will continue to be great without you.
@realDonaldTrump Sad that those heroes would have no voice in the MSM except for you.
@realDonaldTrump saying HRC has mental issues. This coming from a man who has short circuited from day one.

@realDonaldTrump's primary sources of pride are things most people try to avoid their entire lives.

@realDonaldTrump Stick to the issues or take a chance of Losing the election.
@realDonaldTrump such a gross piece of shit. You're as pathetic as yr campaign. What in the world is wrong with you, please stop tweeting SMH
@realDonaldTrump Suggest you make a speech about blatantly biased media - the failure of journalistic ethics. Make it an issue-cite the worst.
@realDonaldTrump Suggest you use HRC screaming video " Why am I not 50 points ahead of Trump " in a clever ad... turn the tables!!!
@realDonaldTrump sure thing right after you release your taxes like Hillary and every candidate has done since Nixon, what r u afraid of?
@realDonaldTrump surprised the Clinton camp of CNN did not blame you for it #trump #Clinton #cnn

@realDonaldTrump They show the crowd and sometimes they zoom in close enough to these morons so I could pick them out of a lineup
@realDonaldTrump thinks African-Americans are ignorant - that's his basis for pandering to them now. But he's wrong.
@realDonaldTrump this from the guy who gets his talking points from what " some people " are saying.
@realDonaldTrump This is why you should not be president. Also, you hate Blacks, so, we won't be voting for you.
